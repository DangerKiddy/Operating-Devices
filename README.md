# Operating-Devices

Hey there!

I know that you want to get more info about this addon, well, catch it! :

It's a base of Operating Devices, that contains custom OS(Operating Systems) in each device
At the moment this base has by default:
1. Laptop
2. PC
3. Printer for computers
4. (SOON) Phones

With that addon you can simply chat with ANY player, no matter that you are at different servers!
Also, you can pretty simply write your own software or apps for this!
You - Why?Do I need lua knowledge?
Me - Because it's just a simple DFrames!And yes, you need Lua knowledge

I can say that it's like "PCMod", but newer and easier!
